## PDF Text-Based Question-Answering

### Description
This program is designed for processing and analyzing text extracted from PDF documents. It enables users to ask questions about the contents of a PDF and receive answers based on the text. The program operates by downloading a specified PDF document from the internet, converting it to text, and then using advanced text processing and machine learning techniques to analyze the content.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI API key
- Libraries: `os`, `requests`, `textract`, `OpenAI`, and `FAISS`.

### Setting Up
1. **OpenAI API Key**: You must have an OpenAI API key. Set it as an environment variable in your system.
   ```python
   os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = 'Your_OpenAI_API_Key'
   ```

2. **Library Installation**: Ensure all required libraries (`requests`, `textract`, `OpenAI`, `FAISS`) are installed in your Python environment.

### Usage Instructions
1. **Download PDF**: The script downloads a PDF from a specified URL. Replace the URL with the PDF link you want to download.
   ```python
   url = 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf'
   ```

2. **Convert PDF to Text**: The downloaded PDF is automatically converted into text using the `textract` library.

3. **Text Processing**:
   - The text is saved and reopened to prevent encoding issues.
   - A hypothetical `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` class is used to split the text into manageable chunks. Adjust `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` as needed.

4. **Text Embedding and Database Creation**:
   - The script initializes an embedding object using the `OpenAIEmbeddings` class and creates a vector database with FAISS.

5. **Performing a Query**:
   - Define a query and the script performs a similarity search in the FAISS database.
   - Top similar documents are retrieved based on the query.

6. **Question-Answering Chain**:
   - The script formats the query using a predefined `PromptTemplate`.
   - It then loads and runs a QA chain, which uses the OpenAI model to generate answers from the input documents.

### Note
- **Customization**: The script can be customized for different PDF sources, query types, and text processing methods.

### Limitations
- The effectiveness of the script depends on the quality of the PDF, the text extraction accuracy, and the OpenAI model's performance.
